			<h1>Why shop local?</h1>
			<p>We can complain about the lack of jobs in our community, high taxes, 
			and vacant storefronts... or we can do something about it. Face it: 
			most of us don't have a lot of disposable income. After paying for a 
			roof over our heads, utilities, transportation, insurance &mdash; the necessities &mdash;
			we want to save as much as we can on what's left over. We shop the grocery sales. 
			We buy in bulk from warehouse stores. We snag deals online and have products shipped
			directly to our homes. Even for those of us who can afford to buy where we want, we 
			resort to consumerism based on convenience. If we can't find it on the shelf at the
			pharmacy or grocery store, we quit looking and buy it online. We are directly contributing
			to the demise of our local economy.</p>
			
			<p><img src="images/SupportLocal.jpg" alt="Supporting Local at Farmer's Market" class="right"/>Study after study shows that local retailers hire local employees. These businesses pay 
			their fair share of taxes and often support other local businesses that produce the goods 
			they sell. If you spend a dollar at a local, independent business, that dollar recirculates in 
			the local economy three times as much as if you spent that dollar at a chain store. When you 
			invest in a local business, a local business invests in your community, through payroll, reinvested
			funds, profits spent locally by the business owner, and through donations to community agencies. 
			This contributes to your community's long-term wealth.</p>
			
			<p>Small businesses have more flexibility in their decision-making than chain stores or franchises.
			They have more control over their hiring practices and in picking which real estate to purchase for
			their locations. If we want to revitalize our commercial districts and labor opportunities, we need 
			to stop sending our money out of our town to the shareholders of large corporations. It may not be
			reasonable to keep our spending completely local, but let our disposable income stick around town a 
			little while and boost our economy before it leaves our community. We can do this by shopping local, 
			independent businesses right here in our town. </p>
