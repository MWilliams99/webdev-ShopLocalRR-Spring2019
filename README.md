# Web Development Shop Local Website Spring 2019

## Project Description
Local Business website created as the final project for the Spring 2019 CTS-289 System Support Project course at Halifax Community College.  
The class size for this course was just four of us and we were tasked with completing a group project for the final. The assignment was to find a local business or client in want of a website.  
The client we located, rather than wanting a website for a specific business, wanted a website for all local businesses and events to compile information in one location. This website was called *Shop Local Roanoke Rapids* and was hosted for a couple years after completion. Unfortunately the website is no longer operational.  

This project uses HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL to demonstrate what was learned throughout the course and to accomplish the needs of our client. The website was coded to connect to a database also designed as part of the project.

This project began at the start of the Spring 2019 semester with us finding a client to create a website for and planning the layout/content of the website.  
The website was completed on April 19th, 2019.

The Shop Local RR website includes 8 HTML/PHP pages:
- Index; This is the homepage for the website which introduces the user to the website and links to the *Why Local*, *Buy Local*, *Do Local*, *Join Local*, and *Created Local* pages.
- Why Local; This page argues *why* it is important to shop local businesses and participate in the community. 
- Buy Local; This page displays a table of local businesses included in the database and allows the user to narrow the results with a search function.
- Business Info; This page displays further information about a business when the user clicks on a specific business in the table on the *Buy Local* page.
- Do Local; This page displays a table of local events included in the database and allows the user to narrow the results with a search function.
- Event Info; This page displays further information about an event when the user clicks on a specific event in the table on the *Do Local* page.
- Join Local; The webpage for adding a local business or event to the database to be displayed on the *Buy Local* and *Do Local* webpages respectively.  
- Created Local; This is the dedication page that our client wanted to include to thank HCC and the Spring 2019 CTS-289 group for designing and creating the website and database for this project.

## Design Process
Our client provided their requirments for the website and ideas of extras that they would like to see in the website. They gave examples of layouts for the webpages and the feel that the website colors should convey. However, the client was also understanding that we had limited experience creating a whole website and that we were learning best practices for website design. For this reason, they let us have majority say in the design as long as they approved it and could give feedback with each step.

The client provided the written content for the webpages throughout the site. As well as the costs for the domain and database to host the website.

## Acknowledgements
A special thanks to my group members - Garry, Giovanni, and Ingrid for their participation in this project. Everyone had their own role to play in the project, from group leader to wireframe designs. The role I played in the project was to do the main coding for everything, however everyone checked off on each other's work to ensure it was a project we would all be proud to turn in for the final grade.

Thank you to Mr. Emmanuel Obi at Halifax Community College for teaching the Spring 2019 CTS-289 System Support Project course and providing us the materials and challenge necessary for this project.
